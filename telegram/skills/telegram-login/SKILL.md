description: Use when Telegram auth setup, reset, or diagnostics are requested.

1. Explain that Telegram user auth for this plugin happens outside the MCP server because Codex spawns MCP servers headlessly over stdio.
2. Tell the user to generate `api_id` and `api_hash` at `https://my.telegram.org/apps`.
3. Instruct them to run the login command from the plugin checkout root (the directory that contains `mcp_server/`; in a repo checkout that is `telegram/`, in an installed bundle it is `~/.codex/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/telegram/<version>/`):
   `uv run --project ./mcp_server codex-telegram login` — or pass the absolute path, e.g. `uv run --project /path/to/telegram/mcp_server codex-telegram login`, to run it from anywhere.
4. Mention the prompts they will see: API ID, API hash, phone number, login code, and optional 2FA password.
5. Explain that the login flow writes a local JSON session file instead of using the OS keyring. The default path is `~/.config/codex-telegram/default.session`; set `CODEX_TELEGRAM_SESSION_FILE` before login to choose another path.
6. Once login succeeds, use `get_session_info` or `get_me` to confirm the account.
7. For diagnostics without valid auth (storage backend, cache state, runtime paths), call the `telegram_diagnostics` tool — it never requires a connected session.
8. If they want to clear auth, run `uv run --project ./mcp_server codex-telegram logout` from the same directory (or use the `logout` MCP tool with `confirm=true` if destructive tools are enabled).
